# predictive-maintenance

This example illustrates some machine learning approaches to predictive maintenance problems that are common in various businesses. This is a toy example to demonstrate some fundamental concepts of machine learning. The example highlights the importance of correct slicing of data before we attempt to build machine learning models. 


I demonstrate the utility of the following two important concepts that are ubiquitous in predictive maintenance problems:
1. **Curse of Dimensionality** Selecting the right features
2. **Class Imbalance** Oversampling the minority class
